# Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign

# Description
A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread. Doctors diagnose skin cancer in more than 3 million Americans each year, making it the most common type of cancer.

This project's aims to predict malignant moles or benign moles. The data consists of two folders with each 1800 pictures (224x244) of the two types of moles.
